# Bibliometria-Calidad-Valor
This is a bibliometric analysis using the bibliometrics package in R. 

This analysis uses the bibliometrics tools to understand the state of the publications on some topics in some scientific fields. 

The process i have made fot this objetive is the next:

First i downloaded a database composed all the bibliographic information i found in scopus about an specific topic. 
I downloaded the .bib and .csv file. Once its done i proceed to analyse it in Rstudio with the bibliometrix package wich help me to understand the state of this topic, how the science is behaving, how different countries colaborates in order to publish scientific information, among others.
